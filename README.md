Week 7 workshop: linear models

## General information

This repository contains two examples for running linear models.

This is my personal repo forked from the ENVS-193DS-2026  organization. I am the sole contributor. 

## Data and file information

All code files are in the `code` folder, these are .qmd files that have contained models for abalone-pH (`abalone-example.qmd`) and temperature-elevation (`sonadora-temperature-example.qmd`).

Both files indlude code for creating linear models, checking model diagnostics, creating predictions, and visualizing predictions. 

## Rendered output

The rendered output for the abalone-pH model is [here](https://isaacmiller1113.github.io/workshop-07_winter-2026/code/abalone-example.html).   


The rendered output for the Sonadora temperature-elevation model is [here](https://isaacmiller1113.github.io/workshop-07_winter-2026/code/sonadora-temperature-example.html).
